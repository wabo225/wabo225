- Hi, I’m Will Bodron \
With a Physics and math degrees, almost all my knowledge of coding has been self taught. This github page is meant to contain instead of showcase some of my work.
My programmatic interests include statistics, visualization, and simulation \
I’m currently learning integrated circuits just for the fun of it. My last personal learning project was music composition and analog synthesizers! I've also recently been enthralled with Haskell

Perhaps the most comprehensive example of my work to be found on this page is for my work on external cavity diode [https://github.com/wabo225/laserStabilization](laser Stabilization).

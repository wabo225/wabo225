- Hi, Iâ€™m Will Bodron \
With Physics and math degrees, I've learned coding mostly through competitive coding and through work opportunities
My programmatic interests include statistics, visualization, simulation, and machine vision.

Perhaps the most comprehensive example of my work to be found on this page is for my work on external cavity diode [laser stabilization](../../../laserStabilization).
